What is your site's primary purpose?
To display and demonstrate my the skills that I am learning throughout the duration of this course.

Who is your target audience?
At this point my target audience would probably be the other students on the course who maybe reading the blog and anyone wanting an example of my work/progress.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I would like to create websites that are responsive, uncomplicated and can deliver content in an efficient way.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
In order to achieve a good responsive design I would use the coding techniques which have been covered in the last few sprints.  Using the box/boxified concept would be the starting point.  Writing good, clean and efficient code in a structured and correct format is also important and contributes to the speed of the site.  Finding a good balance between the sites aesthetic look and the overall functionality is also important as well.
